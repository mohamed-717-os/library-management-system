# Library Management System

This project is a software solution designed for librarians to manage books and track students who borrow them from the library.

The original repository can be found at: [https://github.com/Husna-POYRAZ/library-management-system](https://github.com/Husna-POYRAZ/library-management-system)  
I made some changes to this repository to integrate the SQL database with C# and I also Arabized the project
